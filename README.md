# Habitat Cookbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/habitat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/habitat) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/habitat.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/habitat)

This cookbook provides resources for working with [Habitat](https://habitat.sh). It is intended that these resources will be included in core Chef at some point in the future, so it is important to note:

- APIs are subject to change
- Code style adheres to chef-core (chefstyle)
- Habitat is a rapidly changing product, and this cookbook may change rapidly as well

(this is a pre-1.0 version, after all)

## Requirements

### Platforms
- RHEL 6+
- Ubuntu 12.04+

### Chef

Chef 12.11, for the `systemd_unit` resource.

Resources are written in the style of Chef 12.5 [custom resources](https://docs.chef.io/custom_resources.html) where applicable or available.

### Cookbooks

This cookbook has no external cookbook dependencies. It does not attempt to maintain backwards compatibility with previous Chef versions.

## Recipes

### default

Installs Habitat on the system using `hab_install`.  If
`node["habitat"]["package"]` is defined, it will install that package and set
up that package as a service.

#### Examples

```ruby
node.default["habitat"]["package"] = "core/redis"
include_recipe "habitat"
```

## Resources

### hab_install

Installs Habitat on the system using the [install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/habitat-sh/habitat/master/components/hab/install.sh).

This resource is written as a Chef 12.5 custom resource.

#### Actions

* `install`: Installs Habitat. Does nothing if the `hab` binary is found in the default location for the system (`/bin/hab` on Linux, `/usr/local/bin/hab` on macOS)
* `upgrade`: Installs the latest version of Habitat, does not check if the binary exists

#### Properties

* `install_url`: URL to the install script, default is from the [habitat repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/habitat-sh/habitat/master/components/hab/install.sh)
* `depot_url`: Optional URL to an alternate Depot (defaults to the public Depot)
* `version`: The version of habitat to install (defaults to latest)
* `channel`: The release channel to install from (defaults to `stable`)

#### Examples

```ruby
hab_install 'install habitat'
```

```ruby
hab_install 'install habitat' do
  version "0.12.0"
end
```

```ruby
hab_install 'install habitat' do
  depot_url "http://localhost/v1/depot"
end
```

### hab_package

Install the specified Habitat package. Requires that Habitat is installed

This resource is written as a library resource because it subclasses Chef's `package` resource/provider to get features such as the multi-package API).

#### Actions

* `install`: Installs the specified package
* `upgrade`: aliased to install

#### Properties

* `package_name`: A Habitat package name, must include the origin and package name separated by `/`, for example, `core/redis`
* `version`: A Habitat version which contains the version and optionally a release separated by `/`, for example, `3.2.3` or `3.2.3/20160920131015`
* `depot_url`: The habitat depot url where packages will be downloaded from (defaults to public habitat depot)

While it is valid to pass the version and release with a Habitat package as a "fully qualified package identifier" when using the `hab` CLI, they must be specified using the `version` property when using this resource. See the examples below.

#### Examples

```ruby
hab_package "core/redis"

hab_package "core/redis" do
  version "3.2.3"
end

hab_package "core/redis" do
  version "3.2.3/20160920131015"
end
```

### hab_service

Manages a Habitat application service using systemd. It will drop off a unit file using the `systemd_unit` provider in Chef.

This resource is written as a library resource because it subclasses Chef's `service` resource/provider to get built in properties and actions.

This resource requires Chef 12.11 or higher.

A future version of this resource may support other service providers.

#### Actions

* `start`: (default action) writes a `systemd_unit` for the application and starts the service
* `enable`: writes the `systemd_unit` for the application
* `stop`: stops the application service

#### Properties

* `unit_content`: Content passed into the `systemd_unit` resource as its `content` property. By default this is a hash that starts the service with `/bin/hab start`.
* `environment`: An environment string to pass into the unit file. By default this contains the location of the SSL certificate from the Habitat `core/cacerts` package.

#### Examples

```ruby
hab_package 'core/redis'

hab_service 'core/redis' do
  action :enable
end

# unit_content as a hash
hab_service 'myorigin/myapp' do
  unit_content({
    Unit: {
      Description: 'myapp',
      After: 'network.target audit.service'
    },
    Service: {
      Environment: 'HAB_MYAPP=workers=3'
      ExecStart: '/bin/hab start myorigin/myapp'
    }
  })
end

# unit_content as a string
hab_service 'myorigin/myapp' do
  unit_content <<-EOF
[Unit]
Description = myapp
After = network.target audit.service

[Service]
Environment = "HAB_MAPP=workers=3"
ExecStart = "/bin/hab start myorigin/myapp"
Restart = "on-failure"
EOF
end
```
